----------------------HARD LEVEL PROBLEM----------------------------

/*
Requirements: DESIGN A PORSTGRESQL TRIGGERS THAT: 

Whenever a new employee is inserted in tbl_employee, a record should be added to tbl_employee_audit like:
"Employee name <emp_name> has been added at <current_time>"

Whenever an employee is deleted from tbl_employee, a record should be added to tbl_employee_audit like:
"Employee name <emp_name> has been deleted at <current_time>"

The solution must use PostgreSQL triggers.

-- Delete an employee
